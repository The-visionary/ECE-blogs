            <p class="lead fs-6"> In simple words, if someone needs to define what computer networking is we can say it
                is the name given to the full scope of how computers communicate with each other. So, a question might
                arise that how the computers communicate with each other? Are there some specific rules which it needs
                to follow? Your guess is correct. A definite set of rules that computer must follow in order to
                communicate properly is called protocol. <br> There are basically two models of Computer Networking -
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>TCP/IP Five Layer Network Model</li>
                    <li>OSI(Open System Interconnection) Seven Layer Model</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model</p>
            <p class="lead fs-6">
                <ol>
                    <li><u>Physical Layer</u> - It represents physical devices that interconnect computers. It follows
                        the protocol 10BaseT,802.11.</li>
                    <li><u>Data Link Layer</u> -It is responsible for communication of network devices by interpreting
                        signals. This layer follows the protocol Ethernet/Wi-Fi with protocol data unit as Frames and
                        MAC Address addressing. </li>
                    <li><u>Network Layer</u> - It allows different networks to communicate with each other through
                        devices known as routers. This layer follows the protocol IP with protocol data unit as
                        Datagram. </li>
                    <li><u>Transport Layerr</u> - It sorts out client and server programs are supposed to get that data.
                        It follows TCP/UDP protocol with protocol data unit as segment following Port #’s addressing.
                    </li>
                    <li><u> Application Layer</u> - It follows HTTP,SMTP protocol and messages as protocol data unit.
                    </li>
                </ol> OSI Seven Layer Model is now not used as much as it is outdated but it must be noted that here
                only application later is divided into three more sub layers.
            </p>
            <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"> Basic Networking Devices </p>
            <p class="lead fs-6">
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Cables</u> - It connects different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted
                        over them.</li>
                    <li><u>Hub</u> - It is a physical layer device that allows communications from multiple computers at
                        once.</li>
                    <li><u>Router</u> - It is a device which helps us to forward data between independent networks.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Duplex & Simplex Communication </p>
            <p class="lead fs-6"> Duplex Communication is the concept that information can flow in both directions
                across the cable whereas in simplex communication the process is unidirectional. Client computer which
                only sends data to the server is Simplex Communication. Client Computer which sends and receives data
                simultaneously is Full Duplex whereas client computer which takes turn to send or receive data is Half
                Duplex. </p>
            <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Some Important Terms & Concepts of Networking</p>
            <p class="lead fs-6">
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Ethernet</u> - It is primarily a standard communication protocol used to create local area
                        networks. </li>
                    <li><u>MAC Address</u> - Also known as Media Access Control Address, is a globally unique identifier
                        attached to an individual network interface.</li>
                    <li><u>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</u> - It is a protocol that establishes a connection
                        between client and server so that data can be sent.</li>
                    <li><u>TCP Control Flags</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>URG (Urgent)-It indicates the segment is considered urgent and pointer field has more
                                data about this.</li>
                            <li>ACK (Acknowledged)-It means that the acknowledgement number field should be examined.
                            </li>
                            <li>PSH (Push)-The transmitting device wants to push data to the receiving application
                                immediately. </li>
                            <li>RST (Reset)-It is used to indicate that the sender will not accept any data. </li>
                            <li>SYN (Synchronize)-It is used when first establishing a TCP connection and makes sure the
                                receiving end knows to examine the sequence number field. </li>
                            <li>FIN (Finish)-When it is set to one, it means transmitting computer doesn’t have any data
                                to send and communication can be closed. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><u>Three Way Handshake</u> - Handshake is a way for two devices to ensure that they are speaking
                        the same protocol and will be able to understand each other. If there are two computers Computer
                        A and Computer B, Computer A sends SYN (Synchronize) flag to Computer B which it receives and
                        sends SYN/ACK flag to Computer A and then again Computer A sends ACK (Acknowledged) flag to
                        Computer B completing the three way handshake.</li>
                    <li><u>Firewall</u> - A device which blocks traffic by meeting certain criteria.</li>
                    <li><u>Domain Name System (DNS)</u> - A global and highly distributed network service that resolves
                        strings of letters into IP addresses for us. </li>
                    <li><u>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</u> - A technology that allows for the extension of a private
                        network to hosts that are not present on the local network.</li>
                    <li><u>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) </u> - It is an encryption technology which only uses 40bits
                        for its encryption keys. WEP was quickly replaced by WPA or Wi-Fi Protected Access. WPA uses
                        128-bit key. Today the most commonly used encryption algorithm for wireless network is WPA2,
                        which uses a 256-bit key. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="lead fs-6"> So, this is a small overview of Computer Networking. Always remember it doesn’t matter
                in which domain you are in you can always search on the Internet and learn new things. Stay humble and
                try out new things and I am sure you will find a topic which you will be interested to learn. In such a
                way as I found out Computer Networking quite interesting to me. So, that’s all for this blog. See you on
                the next one!! </p>

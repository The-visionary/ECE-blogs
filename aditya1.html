        <p>Serverless architecture is a concept, wherein developers earlier developed functionalities which were
          dependent on serverside computing can now be developed and hosted on the client side. This eliminates the
          dependency on serverside components for development.The serverless framework helps to develop and deploy
          serverless applications by using Cloud Platform services.Every serverless service instance is an independent
          unit of deployment, for eg. ‚Äì microservice.It‚Äôs a code, deployed in the cloud, that is written to perform a
          single job.</p>
        <p>Serverless computing, in a nutshell, allows developers to define a code function that a cloud service
          executes as a result of an event. The code could be Java, Python, C# or a variety of other languages, along
          with appropriate dependencies, which are grouped (perhaps in a .ZIP file) and uploaded to a storage service,
          ready to be executed when needed. Some ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù can also be coded directly into the service via a GUI.The
          Cloud vendor provides the Function as a Service model that enables the platform to provide the underlying
          infrastructure (typically a container on an already-provisioned VM or service) and executes the code.</p>

        <p>Serverless is an ideal back-end technology. Obviously, serverless has strengths in analytics, artificial
          intelligence (AI) and IoT, but there‚Äôs nothing to stop it also being used for many of the compute functions we
          commonly associate with VMs today.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Application backends (Web & Mobile) - Display a webpage when triggered by an HTTP event, to make API calls
          to clouds as a result of time, poll or user event.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Real-time Processing - Includes performing analysis on datasets (either on a regular schedule or when a
          dataset is uploaded), cleaning up a dataset such as a log or IoT data prior to processing (particularly when
          that data has to be transmitted)</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Workflows and Automation - Automating backups and other daily tasks and processing dataincluding scheduled
          tasks. </p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Extending & Integrating Systems - To interact with any other number of services and systems in the
          enterprise or across enterprises</p>

        <p>PROS:</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ No server management is necessary as developers never have to deal with the servers. They are managed by
          the vendor. This can reduce the investment necessary in DevOps, which lowers expenses, and it also frees up
          developers to create and expand their applications without being constrained by server capacity.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Developers are only charged for the server space they use, reducing cost as in a 'pay-as-you-go' plan,
          developers are only charged for what they use. Code only runs when backend functions are needed by the
          serverless application, and the code automatically scales up as needed. Provisioning is dynamic, usually
          precise, and real-time.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Serverless architectures are inherently scalable since applications built with a serverless infrastructure
          will scale automatically as the user base grows or usage increases. If a function needs to be run in multiple
          instances, the vendor's servers will start-up, run, and end them as they are needed, and these are faster
          spinning up as they often using containers-based models.</p>
        <br>
        <p>CONS:</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ The serverless computing model cannot be stated as the perfect approach due to performance issues. The
          model itself implies that there will be higher latency in how the compute resources respond to the
          applications‚Äô requirements. In such cases, it would be better to use allocated virtual servers if performance
          is the primary requirement.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ The debugging and monitoring of serverless computing are tricky as well. As it is typically utilizing a
          single server resource, the debugging and monitoring activities become extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Around Security practices, when vendors run the entire backend, it may not be possible to fully vet their
          security, which can especially be a problem for applications that handle personal or sensitive data. Because
          companies are not assigned their own discrete physical servers, serverless providers will often be running
          code from several of their customers on a single server at any given time. This issue of sharing machinery
          with other parties is known as 'multitenancy' and can affect application performance and, if the multi-tenant
          servers are not configured properly, could result in data exposure.</p>
